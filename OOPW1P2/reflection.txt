In OOP244 Workshop 1, I learn about namespaces in C++. Namespaces are used to arrange code into logical groupings and to avoid name conflicts. If two distinct programmers declare a variable with the same name in their code, put the code in multiple namespaces prevents the names from clashing. On the other hand, workshop 1 remind me a lot of knowledge in IPC144 classes. For example, opening a file, closing a file, reading a file and use rewind to resets the record pointer in the file. The difficult part in workshop 1 is use the cStrTool.cpp toLowerCaseAndCopy and strStr functions designing a search function to find partialName irrespective lowercase, uppercase or mix of both still can search in file without error. I spend most of time to found out how to make it done. Change the user input to lowercase first using toLowerCaseAndCopy and store it in lowerPartial. Read the file and change the all name to lowercase store in lowerName using toLowerCaseAndCopy. Finally, using strStr to compare lowerPartial and lowerName if match print the phone detail.
