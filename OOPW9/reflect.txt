During this workshop. I have a opportunity to practise a rule of three. This rule posits that if a class defines one of the following: a destructor, a copy constructor, or a copy assignment operator, it should likely define all three.
C++ provides the above three default functions. I will have memory leak when I use dynamic allocation variables because the default copy constructor or copy assignment operator performs shallow copies. Also, the destructor does not delete the allocated memory. So, I copied the allocated memory and delete it before it was terminated. I also made the Student class's destructor virtual, accounting for its role as a base class to Graduate, to guarantee the correct destructor is invoked in the derived class. 
I  feel litttel difficult during the milestone 4. I need to modifty same module in the past like data, Item module. I spent some time to finish the Perishable module.
