I learnt about member functions and privacy in OOP244 Workshop 3. Member functions enables programmers to use class to hole the object. First, use the keyword class identifies a class that is private by default and keyword public is to identifies all members listed in the class can use by outsider. For example, in class Train identifies the member variables in private and identifies all function in public. When need use member function void Train::initialize() the Train:: is the important thing to identifies it as a member of out Train type. When want to modify the private data use the Train::set to do it. void Train::set(const char* name) void Train::set(int noOfPassengers, int departure) void Train::set(const char* name, int noOfPassengers, int departure). Also, I use the width to set the spacing to fit the output cout.width(11); The hardest thing is to transfer the Train name to another name it spend me a lot of time to do it I need to find the ipc144 notes to finished this workshop.
